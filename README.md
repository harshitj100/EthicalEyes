# **Dark Pattern Detection Using NLP and BERT**

## **Project Overview**
This project develops a machine learning system to automatically detect dark patterns in website text content. Dark patterns are deceptive user interface designs that manipulate users into making unintended decisions, such as making purchases, sharing data, or signing up for services. The system uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to analyze text and classify whether it contains manipulative elements.

## **Technical Approach**
The solution employs transfer learning with Google's pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned for dark pattern detection. The model architecture consists of:

1. A BERT preprocessing layer that handles text tokenization and input formatting
2. The BERT encoder that generates contextual word embeddings
3. A custom classification head with dense neural network layers
4. A sigmoid output layer providing probability scores between 0 (legitimate content) and 1 (dark pattern)

The system was trained on a curated dataset of labeled examples containing both legitimate website text and confirmed dark patterns. The training process optimized binary cross-entropy loss using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4.

## **Performance and Accuracy**
The model achieves strong performance metrics:
- Training accuracy: 98.9%
- Validation accuracy: 97.2%
- Precision/recall metrics suitable for production deployment

These results demonstrate the model's ability to reliably distinguish between normal marketing language and manipulative content. The system shows particular strength in identifying common dark patterns like false urgency, scarcity messaging, and confirm-shaming techniques.

## **Implementation Details**
Key implementation components include:
- TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub for model architecture
- Pandas for data handling
- Scikit-learn for dataset splitting and evaluation
- Joblib for model serialization

The model can process raw text inputs and return classification results with confidence scores in real-time, making it suitable for integration into various applications.

## **Applications and Use Cases**
Potential applications include:
1. Browser extensions for real-time website analysis
2. E-commerce platform compliance monitoring
3. Consumer protection tooling for regulatory bodies
4. Design auditing for UX teams

## **Future Enhancements**
Planned improvements include:
- Expanding the training dataset with more dark pattern variants
- Multilingual support using mBERT
- Model optimization for mobile deployment
- Integration with visual analysis for complete UI evaluation
